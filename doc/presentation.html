# Dori

System health probing made easy

---

# Agenda

1. Health probing
2. Probe example using ping
3. Dori server
3. Custom probes
4. Summary

---

# Health probing

Dori lets you monitor the health of a system in non-trivial ways.

If it is scriptable then Dori can monitor it.

For instance:

 * Checking if a database contains the data you expected.
 * Run a Cucumber test of a web site.
 * Run a JUnit/NUnit test.
 * See if the latest Jenkins build is ok.

A Dori probe is just an executable that runs a test of some system to be monitored:

 * If the test is ok, the probe returns 0.
 * If the test is not ok, the probe returns 1.
 * Anything else means that the probe itself failed.

Dori provides a way to integrate custom probes written by you.

---

## Example: probe returning ok

```bash
$ ping -c 1 dr.dk
PING dr.dk (159.20.6.38) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- dr.dk ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 5.106/5.106/5.106/0.000 ms
$ echo Return code: $?
Return code: 0
```

---

## Example: probe failed

```bash
$ ping -c 1 dr.dk
PING dr.dk (159.20.6.38) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- dr.dk ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 0 received, +1 errors, 100% packet loss, time 0ms
$ echo Return code: $?
Return code: 1
```

---

## Example: probe error

```bash
$ ping -c 1 d.rdk
ping: unknown host d.rdk
$ echo Return code: $?
Return code: 2
```

# Dori server

The Dori server exposes a number of probes through http.

 * It lists the number of available tests.
 * Has a nifty upload facility.
 * It runs tests and maps to the follwing HTTP responses:
   * `200 OK` if the test is ok
   * `525 Failed` if the test fails
   * `500 Error` if the test encounters an error when running
   * `404 Not found` if Dori doesn't have the test

---

## Starting the server

The Dori server is just a http server that will run tests when requested to do so.

Run it like this:

```bash
bin/server --port 8080 --key <some key>
```

Leave the server running for the next slides.

Parameters:
 * `port`: what port to listen to (defaults to 80).
 * `key`: upload key to use (should be kept secret).
 * `path`: where to keep the uploaded tests.
 * `debug`: print debug to stdout or stderr when running.

---

## Uploading tests: manifest

Create a file named `test.manifest` in an empty directory. For example:

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "ok",
      "command": "ping",
      "parameters": ["-c", "1", "dr.dk"]
    },
    {
      "name": "fail",
      "command": "ping",
      "parameters": ["-c", "1", "192.168.254.0"]
    },
    {
      "name": "error",
      "command": "ping",
      "parameters": ["-c", "1", "d.rdk"]
    }
  ]
}
```
---

## Uploading tests: uploader

Point the upload tool at the directory with `test.manifest`, and run it:

```bash
$ uploader --url http://localhost:8080/tests/ping --key <some key> --tests .
```

Parameters:
 * `url`: the url where the tests to upload should be exposed (a Dori server must run here).
 * `key`: an upload key for authorization.
 * `tests`: the directory containing `test.manifest`.

---

## Listing the tests

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/tests/
{
  "tests": {
    "/tests/ping/ok": {},
    "/tests/ping/fail": {},
    "/tests/ping/error": {}
  },
  "errors": {}
}
```

---

### Running a test: ping ok

```bash
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/tests/ping/ok
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 247

PING dr.dk (159.20.6.38) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 159.20.6.38: icmp_seq=1 ttl=250 time=3.02 ms

--- dr.dk ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 3.020/3.020/3.020/0.000 ms
```

---

### Running a test: ping fail

```bash
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/tests/ping/fail
HTTP/1.1 525 unknown
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 159

PING 192.168.254.0 (192.168.254.0) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- 192.168.254.0 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 0ms
```

---

### Running a test: ping error

```bash
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/tests/ping/error
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 25

ping: unknown host d.rdk
```

---

# Custom probes

The upload tool is able to upload and install custom test scripts and other executables.

 * Everything in the same directory as `test.manifest` is uploaded.
 * Installation can be done by adding an `install` property to `test.manifest`.

```bash
$ ls -1 http/
http.js       # Our custom test
test.manifest # The manifest file
```

---

## http.js

```javascript
'use strict';

var http = require('http');

var req = http.request(process.argv[2], function(res) {
  console.log(res.statusCode);
  res.on('data', function(chunk) {
    console.log(chunk.toString());
  });
  res.on('end', function() {
    process.exit(res.statusCode < 400 ? 0 : 1);
  });
});

req.on('error', function(e) {
  console.log(e);
  process.exit(2);
});

req.end();
```

---

## test.manifest

```javascript
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "ok",
      "command": "node",
      "parameters": ["http.js", "http://www.google.com"]
    },
    {
      "name": "fail",

      "command": "node",
      "parameters": ["http.js", "http://www.googl.ecom"]
    }
  ]
